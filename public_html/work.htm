<P>How we work: our work team, work party, and committee structure</P></FONT></B>
<IMG SRC="images/uppercourtyard.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="250" alt="upper courtyard" border="1">

Residents work through a number of structures including work teams, work parties, and standing committees (and occasionally task forces). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Work Teams</B><BR>

Every member of the community is on a work team, which meets every six weeks to do general maintenance work.  This includes the children who take on age-appropriate tasks.  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Work Parties</B><BR>

Work Parties occur quarterly and involve about 6 hours of work, with another hour or so for a prepared lunch.  These parties usually address major projects, such as building a stair case, painting, staining fences, major landscape or regrading projects, fixing pavers, etc. Generally, work parties are held one Saturday in March, the first Saturday after Memorial Day, first Saturday after Labor Day, and first Saturday after Thanksgiving.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Committees</B><BR>

Committees do most of the work of the community, including preparation for community decisions.  Some decision-making power is delegated directly to the committees.  Each adult member of the community is expected to participate in a committee.  Besides contributing to getting the work done, being on a committee is a good way to get to know each other.

<P>In early 2001, we redesigned our committee structure to go from topic areas (landscape, finance, meals, etc), to a structure based on systems, and focused on maintenance (roofs, outdoor structures, porch staining, etc.).  <I>We are still evaluating the new structure, but in general, a lot more focused work is getting done. </I> The new committe structure is as follows:</P>

<h4>1. Maintenance Management Committee</h4>

<IMG SRC="images/jays-photos/northsunset.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="250" alt="central courtyard" border="1">

This committee is the heart of the new struture.  Their primary job is to make sure the structure is working, and to assist each committee in getting their own work done.  In addition, they have functions of their own:<ul>

<li>Manages maintenance files (electronic and/or hard copy)
<li>Manages O&M manuals, system information, records and resources (library)
<li>Coordinates weekly Chore Teams and quarterly Work Party lists/schedules
<li>Assists Maintenance-Oriented Committee leads with prioritization of unbudgeted maintenance and repairs 
<li>Manages and publicizes committee assignments
<li>Coordinates general Maintenance Budget with the Finance Committee
<li>Monitor workability of the Systems Oriented Committee Structure Proposal”
<li>Make Minor changes as needed and report to full PRCA group.”
<li>Bring major changes back to the community for consensus.”
</ul>


<h4>2. People Decisions and Services Committee</h4>
Decisions are made using a consensus process.  Residents strive to find consensus on an issue.  In the six years we have been around (not including the very challenging formation process), we have never taken a "majority wins" vote. A consensus process is a lot of work, and sometimes bogs down timeframes, however, it has worked very well for us. The committee is responsible for the following:
<ul>
<li>Schedules PRCA meetings
<li>Trains facilitators
<li>Maintains PRCA Meeting Minutes
<li>Maintains Condo-Docs and By-Laws 
<li>Manages Unit Resale Designation Process
<li>Manages New Member Orientation functions pre- and post-sale of a unit
<li>Maintains PRCA Phone List 
<li>Manages internal social activities 
<li>Manages the CH Calendar
<li>Manages external relations according to adopted policy
<li>Manages disaster preparedness functions

<li>Manages US Mail to CH
<li>Implements Owner/Renter Policies
<li>Prepares and manages committee's operating budget 
</ul>

<h4>3. Meals Committee</h4>
<IMG SRC="images/jays-photos/lineup.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="250" alt="common house meal line" border="1">
Meals are cooked in the <A HREF="commonhs.htm">Common house</A> three nights a week.  A menu is created at the beginning of the month, and residents sign up to shop, cook, and clean (which is required if you want to eat).  This works out to about two chores a month, in exchange for twelve meals a month.  Most residents would agree that the informal visting that happens during meals is the best part of cohousing, and keeps folks connected.  Meals tend to be well balanced, with a slightly vegetarian flair to them.  Residents who are vegetarian, or eat dairy-free are accomodated at each meal. The commitee is responsible for the following:<ul>

<LI>Plans and schedules monthly meals menus
<LI>Maintains sign-up sheets
<LI>Collects member payments and maintains food club books
<LI>Purchases and maintains small kitchen equipment and appliances
<LI>Maintains stock of bulk food items
